## 2. Email Invitation System

### Current Behavior (Default)

**No emails are actually sent** - this is intentional for testing without email credentials.

When you send a friend invitation:

- The system logs the email content to the browser console
- Shows what email _would_ be sent
- Displays a helpful message about enabling real emails
- Everything else works normally (friend requests, pending invitations, etc.)

### What Was Added:

#### Backend (Firebase Functions)

- **New Cloud Function**: `/send-invitation-email` endpoint
- **Email Templates**: Professional HTML and plain text templates
- **Two Email Types**:
  1. **Friend Request** (for existing users)
  2. **Site Invitation** (for new users)
- **Ready for Production**: Code is there but commented out

#### Frontend (Friends Page)

- Updated `sendInvitationEmail()` method
- Clear console messages about email status
- Ready-to-enable code for real email sending (commented)
- References to setup guide

#### Documentation

- **Comprehensive Setup Guide**: `hapi-spoileralert/EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Three email service options:
  1. **Gmail** - Easiest for testing
  2. **SendGrid** - Best for growing apps (100 free emails/day)
  3. **AWS SES** - Best for scale ($0.10 per 1000 emails)
- Step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshooting section
- Security best practices
- Cost comparisons

### How to Enable Real Email Sending:

1. **Read the Setup Guide**: `hapi-spoileralert/EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install nodemailer
   npm install --save-dev @types/nodemailer
   ```

3. **Configure Email Service** (example for Gmail):

   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:set email.service="gmail"
   firebase functions:config:set email.user="your-email@gmail.com"
   firebase functions:config:set email.password="your-app-password"
   ```

4. **Enable Code**:

   - In `functions/src/index.ts`: Uncomment nodemailer import (line 380)
   - In `functions/src/index.ts`: Uncomment email sending code (lines 491-567)
   - In `src/pages/FriendsPage.vue`: Uncomment API call code (lines 714-752)

5. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

### Email Features:

- **Smart Detection**: Differentiates between existing users and new invitees
- **Branded Templates**: Professional HTML emails with your branding
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Clear "Accept Friend Request" or "Join Spoiler Alert" buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Emails look great on mobile and desktop
- **Fallback Text**: Plain text version for email clients that don't support HTML
- **Secure**: Uses Firebase authentication tokens
- **Logged**: All email sends are logged for debugging

### Testing Without Real Emails:

The current setup is perfect for testing because:

- You can see exactly what would be sent (in console)
- No email credentials needed
- No risk of sending test emails to real people
- All other functionality works normally
- Easy to enable later when ready
